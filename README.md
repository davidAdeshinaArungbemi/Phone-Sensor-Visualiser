# Creating a Cool Tool to Visualise gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer in Julia
So, picture this: You've got this nifty app, Phyphox, letting you record sensor data on your phone - magnetometers, accelerometers, the whole deal. But here's the twist, I wanted more. I craved real-time access to that data, something Phyphox wasn't offering. And, oh, did I mention my love for Julia and the awesome dear ImGui?

Cue my journey into the coding adventure! Here's what went down:

## What I Dived Into:
1. Snagging Data with HTTP Queries:
Started pulling in data from the phone in real-time, diving deep into HTTP queries and unlocking the secrets of JSON payloads.
2. Juggling Threads and Async Magic:
To keep things smooth between the fancy graphical interface and the behind-the-scenes action, I got cosy with threads and async programming in Julia.

3. Dear ImGui: My New BFF:
I befriended Dear ImGui, a rad graphical user interface library, to give my tool that slick, modern look and feel.

4. Implot for the Win:
Played around with Implot, a nifty library snug inside Dear ImGui, to whip up some eye-catching plots for the sensor data.

5. Cracking the Optimization Code:
Made the code dance to my tune, constantly tweaking and tuning to ensure my tool was not just cool but fast and responsive.

6. Thinking Outside the Code:
This project was more than just code; it was about tackling problems head-on, thinking creatively, and finding solutions that not only worked but worked brilliantly.

So, here you have it - a little something that showcases my knack for innovation, my love forJulia, and my knack for making things not just work, but work awesomely well. Cheers to real-time sensor data fun! ðŸš€
